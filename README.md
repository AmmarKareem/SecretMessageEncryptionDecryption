# SecretMessageEncryptionDecryption
A program that can encrypt and decrypt secret messages using a encryption formula based on bits of chars

Encryption is dependent on a secret key. Same secret key must be used to decrypt the message.

For decryption, user has to use same key and ciphertext must have sentinel value of -1.

For example if ciphertext is: 178 099 000 141 183 098 104 032 117 088 204 039
User must enter: "178 099 000 141 183 098 104 032 117 088 204 039 -1" (without quotes) for decryption
